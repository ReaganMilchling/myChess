# myChess
 My own personal implementation of Chess using JavaFX
 I am trying to keep the actual board calculations and movements as seperate from the GUI as possible (similar to MVC)
 The plan is to ultimately create a web based player as well. 
 
 A lot of the ideas and a few of the classes currently are heavily borrowed from other people. I have ideas of how to 
 implement some of these classes better. They are marked with todos.
 
 Eventually this project will add PGN readers and an AI to play and test yourself against. I want this project to help
 me study and get better at chess.
